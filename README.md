# Automatic NSFW Anime Wallpaper Changer

## What this script does:

This script goes on [wallhaven](wallhaven.cc) finds random 1980x1080 NSFW anime wallpaper and applies or just downloads it for you. If you'd like to change categories go [here (this is the default url the script goes to)](https://wallhaven.cc/search?categories=010&purity=010&resolutions=1920x1080&sorting=random&order=desc) configure your categories, hit reload, copy url and change the url variable directly in the script (line 12).
